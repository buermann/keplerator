The Rails framework itself is almost superfluous to this project.  The simple HTML5 canvas animation library for building out the models is all in app/assets/javascripts/application.js.  The minimum required to set up a new model of the universe is the following:

<script>
  window.onload = function(){
    var universe = new Universe();
    universe.init();
    universe.setup(); 
  }
</script>

Once things are a little more settled and rationalized maybe we'll write some actual documentation.
