The Rails framework itself is mostly superfluous to this project until we allow users to build their own models.  The simple HTML5 canvas animation library for building out the models is all in app/assets/javascripts/.  The minimum required to set up a new model of the universe is the following:

<script>
  window.onload = function(){
    var universe = new Universe({ sun:{}, earth:{type:'center'} });
    universe.setup(); 
  }
</script>

All the planets as well as Pluto are built in with modern values for their parameters.

Any given planet can be added manually, with these parameters defined at a minimum:

<script>
    universe.planets.xanax = new Planet(universe, {
     name:'xanax', color: "#CC0", aus: 30, mm: .2, size: 70000 
    });
</script>

Deferents are calculated as epicycles, if no epicycles are defined a basic deferent from
the AUs (aus:) and mean movement (mm:) properties will be added.  Here's a more complex
model:

<script>
   universe.planets.mercury.eccentric(6).cycles([
    {mm:-mm,radius:3},
    {mm:mm,radius:18,equant:3},
    {mm:universe.planets.mercury.mm-mm,radius:6},
   ]);
</script>

Note one can apply an arbitrary, static equant to any given cycle in this fashion.
