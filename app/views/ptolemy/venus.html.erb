  The inferior planets' epicycles move on a deferent point that is approximately aligned with the mean sun.  You'll notice the equant in this case nudges Venus' deferent back and forth around the mean sun.

  <p>Note the phase cycle of Venus here with respect to the Earth.  In Ptolemy's model it will never be full.
