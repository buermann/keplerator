  Eudoxus of Cnidus (408BCâ€“355BC), one of Plato's students and a contemporary of Aristotle,
  was the first to propose
  a mathematical model of the planets in his lost work <em>On Speeds</em>.  We only
  know what he proposed from commentaries in Aristotle, Simplicius, Theodosius of Bithynia,
  and a poem by Aratus.  Each planet moved on a system
  of three spheres whose sum of motions caused the planet to move about perpendicular to the
  ecliptic in a sort of figure-8 hippopede, that is, you would flip Mars' figure-8 here on
  it's side if you were looking straight down at the universe.

  <p>When combined with the motion of a fourth sphere that moved the planet around the center
  once a year would generate retrograde motion.  Our 2D plane is insufficient to really 
  demonstrate how this works, it would be much clearer to look at 
  <%= link_to "Todd Timberlake's model", "http://www.compadre.org/OSP/items/detail.cfm?ID=11198" %>.  The model predicted north-south lateral motions for the planets that were far too large, and was a poor predictor of planetary positions in general, but the method of generating retrograde motions from uniform circular motion was quite ingenius.
