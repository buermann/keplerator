Here we have a first draft based on <%= link_to "Richard Fitzpatrick's description", "http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/syntaxis/Almagest/node4.html" %> of Copernicus' heliostatic universe.  The Earth moves on a uniform circular orbit at a small eccentric to the Sun while the Moon moves about the Earth per <%= link_to "Ibn al-Shatir's lunar model", "/shatir/moon/" %> (greatly exaggerated here to scale into frame).  The planets move about the Sun on epicycles that rotate twice as fast as their deferents, with eccentrics about equal to the eliptical eccentricity of their modern orbits.  There's a missing epicycle for Mercury that Fitzpatrick mentions but does not describe.  Mario di Bono says he used the Tusi couple on Mercury in his <%= link_to "1995 paper", "http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995JHA....26..133D" %> (p.147) arguing that Copernicus may have devised it independently as a variation on a similar device by Proclus.

  <p>The great innovation to medieval eyes was ridding the model of the equant.  To Kepler's eyes the great innovation was explaining the retrograde motions of the planets without "the hundred-times-more-absurd spirals".

  <p>The celebrated heliocentricism of his model was probably one it's least interesting features to Copernicus' contemporaries, as Copernicus provided no new evidence for the long-debated movement of the earth, which goes back to at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos">Aristarchus of Samos [310BC]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_of_Seleucia">Seleucus of Seleucia [190BC]</a> and was a common feature in the Sanskrit tradition as described and debated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Rayhan_Biruni#Mathematics_and_Astronomy">al Biruni [973AD]</a>, going back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#Heliocentrism">Aryabhata [470AD]</a>.
