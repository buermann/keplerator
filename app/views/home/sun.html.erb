<div id='lefttext'>Astronomical models were used to determine the relative positions of celestial objects over the course of a year for economic, religious, and astrological reasons.  

  <p>The diurnal movements in which everything rotates together around the Earth, or equivalently (and it was recognized as equivalent by early Islamic astronomers such as the 10th century al-Biruni) the Earth rotates on its axis, are not represented here, as they'd merely introduce an eye watering strobe effect.
