  Ibn al-Shatir (1304â€“1375CE) was timekeeper (<em>muwaqqit</em>) at the Umayyad Mosque
  in Damascus.  In his major astronomical treatise, awesomely titled <em>The Final Quest Concerning the Rectification of Principles</em>, he constructed a model of celestial mechanics with
  no equants or
  eccentrics, solving a variety of theoretical and physical problems of earlier models and
  bringing the mechanics of the heavens in line with contemporary Aristotelian physics.

 This is his model of the Sun, as described by Geoege Saliba
  in his <em>History of Arabic Astronomy</em>, <%= link_to "p.239", "http://books.google.com/books?id=mOquCzBX3xcC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239" %>.  The Sun travels on a pair of epicycles (the clockwise deferent and half-sized, twice-as-fast counter-clockwise director) that re-create 
  uniform motion around an off-center point (the first point 'north' of Earth) without resorting to the equant point.  This alternative to the equant is known as Urdi's Lemma, after the astronomer and architect <%= link_to "Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27ayyad_al-Din_al-%27Urdi" %> (d.1266CE) who discovered it.
