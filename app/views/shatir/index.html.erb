  Ibn al-Shatir (1304â€“1375CE) was timekeeper (<em>muwaqqit</em>) at the Umayyad Mosque
  in Damascus.  In his major astronomical treatise, awesomely titled <em>The Final Quest Concerning the Rectification of Principles</em>, he constructed a model of celestial mechanics with
  no equants or
  eccentrics, solving a variety of theoretical and physical problems of earlier models and
  bringing the mechanics of the heavens in line with contemporary Aristotelian physics.

  <p>This is his model of the Sun, as described by Geoege Saliba
  in his <em>History of Arabic Astronomy</em>, <%= link_to "p.239", "http://books.google.com/books?id=mOquCzBX3xcC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239" %>.
